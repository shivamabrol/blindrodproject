# blindrodproject
This is my final year project in which me and a team of 3 others made a stick for blind people which identifies obstacles and conveys audio information regarding them
Image Processing is used so that the user gets aware of the obstacle in front so that 
proper measures could be taken as the user will get an idea of the class of the object 
approaching hence a strategy to be safe from it could be thought of. 
The obstacle detection is of the utmost priority as if they are not detected the safety of 
the person will be at stake. The obstacle detection is the perception of potentially 
hazardous objects in the environment ahead of time, while the latter one concerns the 
manner to convey obstacle information to the visually impaired people. The obstacle 
detection in this project is focused with ultrasonic sensors, to provide them safety so 
that the mobility is increased and extra help is decreased. 
Ultrasonic sensors emit short, high-frequency sound pulses at regular intervals. If they 
strike an object, then they are reflected as echo signals. Whenever an obstacle is 
detected the commands are issued to “be safe” or “move left/right”, which will help the 
user to be safe and increase the confidence in them. This work will be done on python 
using the Raspberry Pi and NLP modules. 
The basic functionalities that are stated above are the main concern of the project with 
this, the visually impaired will get a lot of help and will be able to compete in the world 
and earn well in life.
